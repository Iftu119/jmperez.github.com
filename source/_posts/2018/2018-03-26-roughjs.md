I love hand-drawn graphs and I have always fantasized about applying it to
vector images. That's why I was very happy to find out about
[RoughJS](https://roughjs.com/), a library that draws SVG primitives like lines,
curves, arcs, polygons, circles, ellipses and paths on a Canvas in a hand-drawn
style.

<div class="codepen-aspect-ratio" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom: 75%; position: relative; width: 100%">
{% codepen milesmanners RMVGbd 0 full 513 684 %}
</div>

The tool can be very handy for given an informal look to diagrams and charts in
some slides or presentations. Do check their [examples
page](https://github.com/pshihn/rough/wiki/Examples), which is very impressive.

If you have a SVG you can draw the primitives that compose it. In the
next example I'm applying RoughJS to [Javi
Velasco](https://twitter.com/javivelasco)'s SF Palace of Fine Arts SVG from
[Zeit's Day](https://zeit.co/day), going through its paths.

<div class="codepen-aspect-ratio" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom:75%; position: relative; width: 100%">
{% codepen jmperez QmqdwQ 0 full 513 684 %}
</div>

#### Contour + RoughJS

In the past I worked on a tool called
[Contour](https://github.com/JMPerez/contour)  that creates a SVG based on the
edges detected on a bitmap image (more info on [this blog
post](/drawing-edges-svg/)).

I wanted to test the combination of Contour and RoughJS, so I took the output of Contour for 3 music album artworks. Contour outputs a SVG with polylines, which doesn't seem to be supported by
RoughJS at the moment, but [it's straightforward to convert to
paths](https://codepen.io/jakealbaugh/pen/GZwgzV).

<div class="codepen-aspect-ratio" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%">
{% codepen jmperez dmzdeb 0 full 684 684 %}
</div>

<small class="caption">RoughJS drawing the above SVGs with some custom options</small>

The effect is very subtle, in part because Contour generates lots of short
lines, but gives the drawing a sketchy style in some traces. Changing the
“simplification” and “roughness” [options](https://github.com/pshihn/rough/wiki)
allows to tweak the result.

If you have read this far you probably like vector images and hand drawing.
[Eric Portis](https://twitter.com/etportis) shared with me recently a SIGGRAPH
2011 paper called “[Animated Construction of Line
Drawings](http://graphics.stanford.edu/~niloy/research/animated_construction_line_drawing/animatedConstructionLineDrawing_sigga11.html)”,
where they infer a plausible stroke order of a static input drawing.

</div>

The predicted stroke is comparable to the order used by human artists. I think
it's really interesting, though I haven't found any actual implementation of the
algorithm on a website.

### Conclusion

RoughJS is another tool that pushes vector images forward, adding an artistic
hand-drawn touch to them. I'm looking forward to see how the project evolves and
how it is applied in different use cases.
