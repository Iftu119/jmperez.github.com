A couple of weeks ago I attended [FrontFest 2017](https://2017.frontfest.ru/) in Moscow. There were around 200 attendees at Digital October, an impressive venue. I had a lot of fun and met many local developers.

FrontFest is one of the several JS conferences that take place in Moscow, which has a healthy web community with several meetups that host up to 500 people.

This single-day event was comprised of 5 tracks filled with talks and workshops. Most of the talks and workshops were in Russian, though there was always one talk or workshop in English at a given time.

I especially liked [Blaine Cook's talk](https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/3/) about UX and developer responsibility managing user authentication. I also enjoyed Mathieu's [live-coding](https://2017.frontfest.ru/lecture/15/) and following workshop, where we coded [a simple yet very fun game](https://github.com/p01/twinStickShooter).

## My talk about "Progressive Image Rendering"

I had been playing with SVG techniques during the weeks before the event, which I had documented on [Using SVG as placeholders — More Image Loading Techniques](/svg-placeholders/). Thus, it was a great opportunity to include them in the talk.

I also mentioned the [Image Decode API](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5637156160667648). I first knew about it through [Mathieu 'p01' Henri](https://twitter.com/p01/), who told me there were early discussions to implement it when we met at [RenderConf Oxford](/render-conf-oxford-2017/). Even though it's not widely supported I thought it was a good opportunity to talk about it.

This API prevents the browser from blocking the UI when decoding an image, and can be handy when doing lazy-load. Check also [this post](https://medium.com/dailyjs/image-loading-with-image-decode-b03652e7d2d2) for an example on how to use it.
